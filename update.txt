Hey everyone! I've released a patch (0.5.1) that fixes some bugs that were encountered on launch.

- If you die while riding Gotta Sleep, the school no longer turns black next game
- The impossible question showing up is no longer based on the number of papers you've collected, but based on the number of questions you've answered
- Control mapper now scales properly, but the cursor appears behind it. I currently do not have a fix for this.

The update is available to download from either GameBanana or GameJolt.
