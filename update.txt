Hey there! Another update has been released (0.5.2).

There's too many additions to list here, but a general explanation of this new update would be that I've updated the menu a bit, fixed some new glitches, and added an endless mode! Those who are signed in to GameJolt can submit thier endless mode scores to a public leaderboard.

With all said, thanks for playing my game and happy new year!
